New in v.0.1.3:
* Added support for Apache Cassandra in the technology library.
* Added support for Spark in technology library. At this time we support
  the stand-alone version only.
* Added support for installing DICE Deployment Service - the server side.

New in v.0.1.2:

* Initial support for deployments reconfiguration. This will enable
  that the existing deployments will not need to be destroyed
  before applying changed configurations to the existing nodes.
* Storm topologies can be reconfigured. This is achieved by simply
  killing existing topology, updating configuration and then
  resubmitting the same topology.
* Added configuration field to Storm topology. Now the users'
  Storm topologies can receive arbitrary configuration to be
  applied at submission.
* Storm topology submission is now idempotent. Topology equality
  is determined by comparing names, so the same jar can still run
  multiple times on storm, but it needs ta have different names for
  each execution.
