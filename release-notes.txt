New in v.0.2.1:

* Added firewall rules for Zookeeper, Storm, Cassandra as a node types.
* Apache Storm topology can now be parametrized, supplying user's custom command
  line parameters to the topology submitter.
* Enabled DNS query redirection to the Consul micro DNS server installed with
  the DICE deployment service.
* Abstracted virtual IP address to mask differences in platforms (floating
  IPs in OpenStack, etc.)
  * On FCO platform, virtual IP does not really exist, hence for FCO it is
    mapped to a dummy node template.
* Made DICE library modular, loadable through nested imports. This change
  requires that Cloudify Manager 3.4.0 is used as the back-end.
* Added task for downloading selected resource during the Cloudify workflows
  to prepare files for Chef recipes, which themselves have no access to
  Cloudify resources.
* Enabled merging and deduplication of inputs and other lists.

New in v.0.1.3:
* Added support for Apache Cassandra in the technology library.
* Added support for Spark in technology library. At this time we support
  the stand-alone version only.
* Added support for installing DICE Deployment Service - the server side.

New in v.0.1.2:

* Initial support for deployments reconfiguration. This will enable
  that the existing deployments will not need to be destroyed
  before applying changed configurations to the existing nodes.
* Storm topologies can be reconfigured. This is achieved by simply
  killing existing topology, updating configuration and then
  resubmitting the same topology.
* Added configuration field to Storm topology. Now the users'
  Storm topologies can receive arbitrary configuration to be
  applied at submission.
* Storm topology submission is now idempotent. Topology equality
  is determined by comparing names, so the same jar can still run
  multiple times on storm, but it needs ta have different names for
  each execution.
